# Standing decisions
# The loop obeys these without pausing. Spending money is the only gated action:
# anything not authorized below causes a clean pause (not a frozen prompt).

## Spending
- spend-budget-usd: 0
- No new npm packages this phase. No paid API calls during the implementation loop.

## Notes (Programs Phase 3 — Template Builder)
- Source spec: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-01-programs-phase3-templates-design.md
- Source plan: docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-01-programs-phase3-templates.md
- No new npm packages, no new tables — one boolean column `programs.is_template`.
- Codex handles text edits only; conductor runs all shell/build/git and the DB migration via Supabase MCP.
- pnpm is the package manager. Verification gate = `pnpm run build`.
- Windows: Codex workspace-write sandbox cannot spawn subprocesses. Text edits only.
- Templates are edited via the existing ProgramExplorer — no new authoring UI.
- Duplicate endpoint copies category tree + note/link assets only; never copies file-based assets
  (avoids Storage duplication cost and a shared-storage_path delete hazard).
- Duplicating requires only view access to the source program (owner or org member).
- GET /api/programs defaults to is_template=false when no query param given — Phase 4's
  session-link picker and the dashboard's existing programs list must be unaffected.

## Notes (Programs Phase 4 — Link a Program to a Session) [complete, kept for reference]
- Source spec: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-01-programs-phase4-session-link-design.md
- Source plan: docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-01-programs-phase4-session-link.md
- Session mutations go through the direct browser Supabase client, matching the existing
  SessionDetailClient.tsx pattern — no new API route, no new client-side role gating (RLS-only,
  consistent with how Delete Session/todo edits already work in that file).
- CategoryTree/AssetGrid are reused unmodified with canManage={false} for the read-only drawer.
- Program picker filters GET /api/programs results client-side to org_id === session.org_id.
